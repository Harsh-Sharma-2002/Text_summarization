# **SkimLit:** NLP Project for Document Summarization
### **Overview**
SkimLit is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) project aimed at building a document summarization tool using machine learning techniques. The project focuses on summarizing scientific research papers to extract key information efficiently.

### **Data**
* PubMed 20k is a subset of PubMed 200k. I.e., any abstract present in PubMed 20k is also present in PubMed 200k.
* PubMed_200k_RCT is the same as PubMed_200k_RCT_numbers_replaced_with_at_sign, except that in the latter all numbers had been replaced by @. (same for PubMed_20k_RCT vs. PubMed_20k_RCT_numbers_replaced_with_at_sign).
* Since Github file size limit is 100 MiB, we had to compress PubMed_200k_RCT\train.7z and PubMed_200k_RCT_numbers_replaced_with_at_sign\train.zip. To uncompress train.7z, you may use 7-Zip on Windows, Keka on Mac OS X, or p7zip on Linux.
